Here's a thread on what i have learned through this podcast.

1/12: "Courses, certificates, and rewards are the by-product, though a person inhales that course is a product". Focus on the skills you need to acquire, not on degrees or certificates you get. #careeradvice #skillset

2/12: Chat-GPT or any other AI is just a tool to curate data and give you specific information in an asked format. Remember, "Information is always free only implementation has a fee". #AI #information

3/12: Basic reasons why Indians living in India are not able to achieve bigger things! First, Indians generally don't raise their standards as they grow; they fall into a comfort zone, especially when they get a good job. Secondly, "Delayed  Appereciation" in india employes do not get immediate appereciation which results into lack of motivation. #Indianworkculture #comfortzone

4/12: In freelancing, always remember if you are in the right marketplace where your clients can see you and you can provide them value. Focus on "pull marketing" and be like "Darumas doll" which stands itself after falling down. #freelancingtips #valueproposition

5/12: The secret of Top 1% freelancers is that they repeat the same thing daily basis and don't get bored out of it. If you want to achieve something extraordinary, keep improving your basic skill set. #skillimprovement #topfreelancers

6/12: To grow on LinkedIn, think of it as a market where your shop is located. Your shop should be attractive so that any passing customer takes a look at it because LinkedIn works on dual-time algorithm in which profile ranking are improved on the basis of time spent of viewer on your profile. #LinkedInmarketing #attractiveness

7/12: In order to improve your LinkedIn profile, be careful about some things: keep a professional photo, manage all sections properly, focus on getting testimonials from clients, enter the location where you want to work not from where you work, and make more relevant connections. #LinkedInprofiletips #LinkedIngrowth.

8/12: Whatever you do in your life, whether freelancing, job, or as a student, always try to give 10X value. If someone is giving you 100 rupees, then you should do a job of 1000 rupees. This is the most powerful mantra to grow in your professional life. #valueproposition #Powerfulmantra

9/12: Eligibility and employability are two different things. Learn the difference; any college degree can ensure you eligibility, not employability. #employability #collegedegree

10/12: It is not important to have fancy degrees from IIT, IIM to be successful. If you don't have it, then build qualities and skills like people who have it, build curiosity like them, build a mindset like them to get the results like them. #successmindset #skillbuilding

11/12: In order to connect with people who are from IIT, IIM on social media, you have to give them the value they want. Overlap your interests with them. #socialmediastrategy #connections

12/12: At the end keep listening, keep learning All the best!! .
