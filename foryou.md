 Ham students zomato aur swiggy se khana oder karte hai. Agar ham ek ajj ka normal scenario dekhe toh hamare collage mai he agar mai apne hostel ki batau toh raat mai karib 40-50 order ho jate hai .Aur ye bas mai ek sai hostel ki baat ki hai aur yaha akele graphic era collage mai 13 hostel hai aur kafi bacche PG vagra mai bhi rahate hai . Toh agar ham ek normal estimate lagae toh karib ek raat mai minimum 400-500 order hojate honge aur ye order bas raat k hai .<br>
Aur ye order jab atta hai toh students ko usk lea wait bhi karna padta hai hai aur ye khana zada garam bhi nahi hota  maximum cases mai aur sabse important ki us khane k lea paise bhi zada dene padte hai.<br>
Toh agar assa ho jae ki student ko ya jo koi bhi khana order kar raha hai usse khana minimum time mai mil jae aur  khana garam bhi ho aur khana k paise bhi kaam dene pade. Toh kesa hoga. 
Mera idea isse cheez k upar hai agar mai ek food delivery service kholu like Cloud kitchen ismai kya hota  issmai tum khana banate ho aur order anne par deliver karte ho . Restaurant ki trah beth k khane ki facility nahi hoti bas delivering hoti hai. 
Abb question aega ki phir usmai kya alag hua food delivery toh zomato aur swiggy jese  bhi karti hai. Toh ismai kya alag hua . <br>
Zomato aur swiggy jese company kya karti hai vo restaurant se partnership karti hai aur aur apni website k order se order leti hai unk restaurant aur phir food deliver karti hai aur phir restaurant wale se uska commission leti hai. 
Iss kya hota ki automatically uss order ka price baad jata hai. Aur agar restaurant door hua toh delivery ka time bhi. Aur isse dikkat customer ko hoti hai. <br>
Ham kya karenge ham apna ek kitchen banaenge aur we can say cloud kitchen aur phir food delivery ka bussiness shuru karenge ek app ya phir website par order linge  ya call kark bhi order de skte hai .
<br>
Ham apna jo outlet hoga collage aur hostels k pass rakhnege jese maximum 1-2 km ka distance ho har hostel se  aur jo bacche PG vagera mai rahate mai rahate hai unse bhi pass padega because jadatar bache PG ya Room collage k pass lete hai .<br>
Abb apna kitchen ya outlet hostel aur collage k pass rakhne ka faeda us kya hoga ki delivery ka time kam hoga aur ham cycle par bhi delivery kar skte hai aur phir fuel k paise bhi bach jaenge 
iss ham food delivery ki cost  bhi kam ho jaegi aur dusri baat food deliver karrne mai time bhi zada nahi lagega . Aur khana bhi freshly cooked aur garam deliver hoga.Toh jen 3 problem thi vo solve ho gai.<br>
1. FAST Delivery <br>
2. Less Charage <br>
3. Hot Food <br>

Par kuch important cheez hai jinka Dhyan rakhna hoga jese 
### 1. Food ki quality 
### 2. Very important taste
### 3. Multiple Food options 

Aur agar inn sab baato kaa dhyan rakhe aur apna bussiness shuru kare toh ye kitne bade scale par ja skta hai chalie dekhte hai 

 <br>
  suppose 1 din mai minimun 400 order on average 120 rupee ka ek order <br>
    400*120=48,000
    IN ONE WEEK = 48,000*7 = 3,36,000.<br>
    IN ONE MONTHS = 3,36,000 * 30= 1,00,80,000.<br>
    IN ONE YEAR= 12,09,60,000.<br>
    APROXIMATLY= 12 CRORE from one collage in one year .<br>
    Aur kisne bola ki ham ek collage par rukne wale hai phele 1 collage phir dusra phir tesra aur phir 5 saal mai agar ham including collage,society,colony etc total 60 palces par operate karte hai toh roughly <br>
    Total Revenue  = 720 crore 
    IF Profit Margin 30%, then Profit in year   = 217 crore. <br>
    Aur ek baat ham apna outlet ek particular section ko target kark kholte hai like collage, hostels, PG's , sociaties, colony etc. <br><br><br><br><br>

We, as students, order food from Zomato and Swiggy. If we look at a normal scenario, in our college alone, if I talk about my hostel, around 40-50 orders are placed at night. And this is just for one hostel, and there are 13 hostels in Graphic Era College alone, with many students also living in PGs. So, if we estimate normally, there would be around 400-500 orders in one night, and these orders are only for the night.

When the food arrives, students have to wait for it and the food is not very hot in most cases. Also, they have to pay more for the food. 

What if the food is delivered quickly, hot, and at a lower cost? My idea is to open a food delivery service like Cloud Kitchen where food is prepared and delivered upon order. There won't be any facility to sit and eat like a restaurant, only delivery services will be provided. 

The difference between this and companies like Zomato and Swiggy is that they partner with restaurants and take orders through their website. They then deliver the food and take a commission from the restaurant. This automatically increases the price of the order. Also, if the restaurant is far away, it takes more time for delivery, which is a problem for customers.

We will set up our own kitchen or outlet near the college and hostels, within a maximum distance of 1-2 km from each hostel. We will also keep it close to students living in PGs because most of them take accommodation near the college. 

The advantage of having our outlet near the college and hostels is that delivery time will be reduced and we can deliver by cycle which will save fuel costs. This will reduce the cost of food delivery and also ensure that the food is freshly cooked and hot when delivered. 

So, we have solved three problems:
1. FAST Delivery
2. Less Charge
3. Hot Food

But there are some important things to keep in mind, such as food quality, taste, and multiple food options. 

If we focus on these things and start our business, it can scale up to a large extent. Let's see an example: 
Suppose in one day, we receive a minimum of 400 orders with an average order value of 120 rupees. <br>
400 * 120=48,000 IN ONE WEEK = 48,000*7 = 3,36,000.<br>
IN ONE MONTHS = 3,36,000 * 30= 1,00,80,000.<br>
IN ONE YEAR= 12,09,60,000.<br>
APROXIMATLY= 12 CRORE from one college in one year.<br>

And who said we will only stay in one college? First one college, then another, and then a third. In five years, if we operate in a total of 60 places including colleges, societies, colonies, etc., then roughly the total revenue would be 720 crore.<br><br> If the profit margin is 30%, then the profit in a year= 217 crore profit

And one more thing, we will target a particular section like colleges, hostels, PGs, societies, colonies and then we will open our outlet targeting that particular section.
